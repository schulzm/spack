    """A toolkit with infrastructure for representing, summarizing, and
    visualizing tree-structured regression and classification models. This
    unified infrastructure can be used for reading/coercing tree models from
    different sources ('rpart', 'RWeka', 'PMML') yielding objects that share
    functionality for print()/plot()/predict() methods. Furthermore, new and
    improved reimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree()) and
    model-based recursive partitioning (mob()) from the 'party' package are
    provided based on the new infrastructure."""
